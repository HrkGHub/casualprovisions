# Casual Provisions

A Darkest Dungeon Mod

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083831112>

Shows provisions suggestions on the right side of the expedition preparation screen based on a bunch of different guides/wikis and other mods.

Mainly for people like me who come back to the game every few months and can't remember how many of the provision items they should take with them.

Please - treat these values as a guide/suggestion, feel free to adjust the amount to your liking if you feel you're taking too much or too little with you.

I'm also providing the blank template file so you can write your own values onto the background image with your favorite image editing application like Paint, Gimp or Photoshop.
Color values I used: plain white|short, orange|medium (#ffcd03), red|long (#ec2818).

Guide should be pretty self explanatory - take the basic stuff like torches / food and shovels for the appropriate length and look at the specific area for the other provisions and any extra basic stuff you should add.
Blacked out items are not needed. Icon before area names is the primary damage type the enemies are dealing.
